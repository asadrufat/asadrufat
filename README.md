### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Rufat Asadli, a graduate student researcher through [NetFabric.ai](https://netfabric.ai/) & [Networked Systems Group](https://nsg.ee.ethz.ch/) collaboration, and at [Rycolab](https://rycolab.io), as well as an MSc Statistics student at ETH Zurich. I am fascinated by the world of mathematics and machine learning, and I am driven by one intriguing question: how close are we to creating machines that not only solve problems but also become problems? Exploring that boundary is what keeps me going.
