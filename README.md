## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rufat Asadli, a graduate researcher at Rycolab and an MSc Statistics student at ETH Zurich. I am fascinated by the world of mathematics and machine learning, and Iâ€™m driven by one intriguing question: how close are we to creating machines that not only solve problems but also become problems? Exploring that boundary is what keeps me going.
