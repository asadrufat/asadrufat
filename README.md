### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Rufat Asadli, a graduate student researcher at [Rycolab](https://rycolab.io) and an MSc Statistics student at ETH ZÃ¼rich. I am fascinated by the world of mathematics and machine learning, and I am driven by one intriguing question: how close are we to creating machines that not only solve problems but also become problems? Exploring that boundary is what keeps me going.
